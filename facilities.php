			<p>
			  At Mt Albert Grammar School the music department offers many opportunities for students to make and play music in school
			</p>
			
			<p>
			 In the E block of the school there are multiple practice rooms with a wide range of instruments to practice and play on. In these practice rooms you can also book lessons through the school to learn an instrument during school time!
			</p>
			
			<p>
			Tucked away between two classrooms is the recording room. In this room you can record covers or even your own originals. The room is sound proofed, has many instruments to choose from and a recording station equiped with a great mixing station.
